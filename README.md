[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/col6y/libca.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/col6y/libca)

libca is an in-development alternative to the API of the C standard library.

Currently the API is not well-documented.

This repository is the reference implementation of the API.

There exist a set of tests that may be able to be used for any implementation.

The current (incomplete) implementation is based on [libsyscall](https://github.com/col6y/libsyscall).
